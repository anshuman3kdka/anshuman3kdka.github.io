# Site Notes

This repository hosts a static writing portfolio with a generated search index.

## Search indexing

Search data is generated by `scripts/generate-search-index.mjs`.

- The script scans Markdown and HTML content files in the repo.
- It extracts `title`, `category`, `url`, and plain-text `content` snippets.
- It writes output to a single canonical file consumed by the frontend:
  - `search.json`

Run it with:

```bash
npm run generate:search-index
```

`npm run build` currently runs the same indexing step.

## Automatic indexing on content changes

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/auto-update-search-index.yml`) now runs on pushes that modify content files.
It regenerates `search.json` and commits any updates automatically.

## Pages CMS media uploads

This repo is configured so Pages CMS can upload images to `assets/uploads/`.

- In the editor, use image fields such as `Featured Image (optional)` and `Project Image (optional)`.
- You can also add inline images inside Markdown content using the image button.
- Uploaded files are stored in `assets/uploads/` and referenced with `/assets/uploads/<filename>`.

If image uploads do not appear, verify Pages CMS has write access to the repository branch.

## Image optimization + publishing checklist

Use this quick process before publishing posts with images:

1. **Upload smaller images**
   - Compress images before upload using free tools like Squoosh or TinyPNG.
   - Target roughly **150–250 KB** for regular content images when possible.
2. **Cloudflare optimization settings**
   - Enable **Polish** if your Cloudflare plan includes it (if unavailable, skip it).
   - Enable **Auto Minify** for **CSS, JS, and HTML** under **Speed → Optimization**.
3. **Simple pre-publish checks**
   - Avoid uploading huge originals directly from phone cameras.
   - Prefer modern formats such as **WebP** when your CMS supports them.

## Additional Pages CMS configuration

The CMS now includes broad editing coverage for content + site chrome:

1. **SEO fields:** collections and pages include optional `description` fields for metadata-friendly summaries.
2. **Single-page editing:** all major page files are editable directly (`index.md`, `about`, `contact`, `resume`, `creative`, and listing pages).
3. **Site settings panel:** `_data/site.yml` powers header title/link, nav links, search placeholder, footer heading/note, contact info, and social links.
4. **About portrait controls:** about photo URL, alt text, and caption are editable through CMS and rendered directly on the page.
5. **Home page cards:** `_data/home_cards.yml` provides repeatable cards with type, title, description, link text, and link URL fields.
6. **Featured cards section copy:** site settings now include editable eyebrow, title, and subtitle text for the homepage featured cards area.

These are wired into the live layout:

- `<meta name="description">` uses each page's `description` when provided.
- Header brand text/link and navigation read from `_data/site.yml`.
- Footer heading/text/social links read from `_data/site.yml`.
- Homepage hero title/tagline read from `_data/site.yml`.

## Cloudflare caching checklist

After deploying content updates, keep Cloudflare caching configured for static asset performance while avoiding stale HTML.

1. **Caching → Configuration**
   - Set **Browser Cache TTL** to at least **1 month** for static file reuse.
   - Keep **Always Online** enabled.

2. **Rules → Cache Rules**
   - Add rules for static paths and extensions such as:
     - `/assets/*`
     - `*.css`, `*.js`, `*.jpg`, `*.png`, `*.webp`, `*.svg`, `*.json`
   - Set **Cache eligibility** to **Eligible for cache**.
   - Set **Edge TTL** to a long duration (for example, **1 month**).

3. **HTML caching**
   - Keep HTML caching conservative unless you have a clear cache-purge workflow.
   - If you cache HTML aggressively, purge cache after publishing updates.

4. **Post-publish purge**
   - Use **Caching → Purge Cache** after publishing changes.
   - Do selective purges where possible; use full purge when needed.
