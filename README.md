# Site Notes

This repository hosts a static writing portfolio with a generated search index.

## Search indexing

Search data is generated by `scripts/generate-search-index.mjs`.

- The script scans Markdown and HTML content files in the repo.
- It extracts `title`, `category`, `url`, and plain-text `content` snippets.
- It writes output to:
  - `search.json`
  - `assets/search-index.json`

Run it with:

```bash
npm run generate:search-index
```

`npm run build` currently runs the same indexing step.
