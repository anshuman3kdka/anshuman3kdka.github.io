# Site Notes

This repository hosts a static writing portfolio with a generated search index.

## Search indexing

Search data is generated by `scripts/generate-search-index.mjs`.

- The script scans Markdown and HTML content files in the repo.
- It extracts `title`, `category`, `url`, and plain-text `content` snippets.
- It writes output to:
  - `search.json`
  - `assets/search-index.json`

Run it with:

```bash
npm run generate:search-index
```

`npm run build` currently runs the same indexing step.

## Automatic indexing on content changes

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/auto-update-search-index.yml`) now runs on pushes that modify content files.
It regenerates `search.json` and `assets/search-index.json` and commits any updates automatically.

## Pages CMS media uploads

This repo is configured so Pages CMS can upload images to `assets/uploads/`.

- In the editor, use image fields such as `Featured Image (optional)` and `Project Image (optional)`.
- You can also add inline images inside Markdown content using the image button.
- Uploaded files are stored in `assets/uploads/` and referenced with `/assets/uploads/<filename>`.

If image uploads do not appear, verify Pages CMS has write access to the repository branch.

## Additional Pages CMS configuration

The CMS now includes three important improvements:

1. **SEO fields (item 5):** collections now include `description` fields for metadata-friendly summaries.
2. **Single-page editing (item 6):** `about/index.md`, `contact/index.md`, and `resume/index.md` are editable directly as file entries.
3. **Site settings panel (item 8):** `_data/site.yml` is editable in CMS under `Site Settings` with title, tagline, contact, location, and social links.
