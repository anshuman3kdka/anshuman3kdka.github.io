title: Six Till Night (Sun's Version)

The Sun has found a flare,  
A flame in November,  
A true heart not a snare,  
A love to remember.  
.  
A love to remember his warmth,  
Not tear what one can never fix.  
The tears he bears, the smile he wears,  
When he's at your doorstep at six.  
.  
From six till night, his world is yours,  
But all the time, his world is you.  
He searches all the day for shore,  
But six till night, his land is you.  
.  
Journeys the Wild West, Eastern skies,  
He needs and heals the Orcish cries.  
He finds home in your Elven tongue,  
And rhymes the song your heart has sung.  
.  
You're his red poem, you're his sunshine,  
You're what the Fates for him destined.  
You're love, you're lust, you're sin, you're crime,  
Go grab that kiss and say, “You're mine”.
