The world has stopped, the bell has tolled,  
People have broken out of mould,  
They have rushed to the city gate,  
“Satan's here, a soul he has sold.”  
.  
They watch like the statues  
they'd always been.  
The light being returned  
to the hollowed being.  
Now-darkened hair ride on  
the wrinkled head.  
“The Lord is the Devil”  
philosophers said.  
.  
When Man perishes then God too dies,  
He's in our heads, but He's not lies.  
We thought Him up, yet still He's there,  
He thinks like Man, like Man He sighs.  
.  
When the men worship Him  
they praise Him not.  
They worship the richness  
of their own thought.  
The greatest invention  
of Man ain't wheel.  
Adam's the Creator,  
Creation is God.
