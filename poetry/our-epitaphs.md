An unused toothbrush beside mine  
It’s there for weeks, exactly nine.  
They ask why I keep it with me,  
Just ‘cause I’m waiting for springtime.  
.  
When springtime sets I’ll give it back,  
To who I inherently lack,  
My soul would be a whole once more,  
We’ll carve our feet on muddy track.  
.  
For future lovers who walk by,  
Away from world and those who pry,  
They’ll set eyes on our Epitaphs,  
“Here lies the Sun and his pink Sky”   
.  
For now the toothbrush stands forlorn,  
Biding the seasons not yet born,  
This year the cherries might not bloom,  
There might not be a dewy morn.  
.  
Not yet but if you wait a year,  
The doves will carry your prayer,  
The toothbrush will see spring again,  
You won’t know fear, shall shed no tear.
