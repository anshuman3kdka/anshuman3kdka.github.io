It’s been a while since I last wrote,  
For there’s nothing worth writing of.  
A nightingale tore off her throat,  
For there’s nothing worth singing of.  
.  
It’s not just love that is lacking,  
The purple rain too, is now slack.  
Their eyes warn that the past repeats,  
They avoid red, for fear of black.  
.  
I wish I saw some new heartbreak,  
Some new love for poetry’s sake.  
The racy passions to despise,  
I need another love’s demise.  
.  
I don’t like the sky to be grey,  
Either be red, or bitter black.  
But grey skies? They’ve nothing to say,  
They just exist as poets’ rack.  
.  
I watch new couples, for new verse,  
Instead of red, their hearts are grey.  
I search for black or vicious curse,  
And end up dull in faded May.  
.  
Where’s his new muse? Where’s her black rose?  
Where’s the butterflies? Where’s your prose?  
Where’s the ecstasy? Why so grey?  
Was this the destiny you chose?  
.  
Grey kills love, don’t let it get close.
