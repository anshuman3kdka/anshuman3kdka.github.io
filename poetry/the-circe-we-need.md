Oh hello sir, nice meeting you,  
Men of your bearings are quite few,  
Please stay away, that's blood not stew!  
You'll soon be part of the same brew.  
.  
You see, a heart that's always true,  
Not affected by evil’s flu,  
Not saddened in the days of blue,  
Nor gladdened by a murder's view,  
Is what we need for this concoction,  
We'll sell it at Friday's auction,  
To orphans who seek adoption,  
Safe life was never an option.  
.  
Fear not! It's not a mutant drink,  
Nor for it do the werewolves sing,  
It does its job before you blink,  
Now ships will sail in seas of ink.  
.  
So please sir before you supper,  
Take a small minute to suffer,  
You'd give your heart, were you tougher,  
For Hecate’s sake sir! Don't stutter!  
.  
My cause is just and so are you,  
Come ruin this globe, build it anew.
