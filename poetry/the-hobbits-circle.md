Clutching the schoolbag, he sets out,  
With shiny shoes and polished belt,  
His heart so stout, no look of doubt,  
He'll see what's seen, he'll feel what's felt.  
.  
He climbs aboard the yellow bus,  
The bus that visits 'maturity',  
He'll see white rust, the classroom dust,  
Which prepares him for the City.  
.  
You see, he's quite unused to it,  
This world of crime, this world of grime,  
He loved these meadows, where would sit,  
A world of rhymes, no place for time.  
.  
And yet his village sends him off  
With passions too big for his back,  
Into a life of suits and scoff,  
To return with a huge green sack.  
.  
They say this sack will fix all  
"But what's broken?" was never asked  
It's said to bring you love and crawl,  
Into your heart like a wine flask.  
.  
And love, of course, in this world is,  
No heart's affair, no place for lack,  
But rather it's a simple choice,  
Of who carries the biggest sack.  

He travels long and votes his king,  
And sleeps alone with a magic Ring,  
He forgets wings and larks that sing,  
And wakes to a life of 'meaning'  
.  
And yet, and now, his feet get slow,  
It tires him, his sack's green glow,  
He sets it down, and looks down south,  
A place where he had started out.  
.  
An orange sunset is calling  
Away from crime, away from grime,  
He stumbles back, where Autumn's falling,  

In flowers of rhymes, no place for time.
