The night's Aurora's glowing green,  
Like poison ivy, poison scheme.  
With plotting fangs the nature teems,  
That's why it's green, or so it seems.  
.  
It runs in me, to green's delight,  
To snake inside without a fight.  
The venom's black, so black and bright,  
Glistening alone in moonless night.  
.  
Glistening in me like it's her home,  
The green venom, my mouth in foam.  
The kid in me alone does roam,  
The cold marble, like martyr's dome.  
.  
Let herself in without my wish,  
The birds of prey? Or hunts of fish?  
Sauntered along a dizzy bliss,  
Pulled me into a deep, green kiss.
