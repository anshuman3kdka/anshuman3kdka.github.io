[Verse 1]  
I'm bad at this, as you'll now see,  
But you left not a choice for me,  
As you've touched something close to soul,  
You've fixed this hole, made me a whole.  
.  
[Bridge]  
Our past four days, like some past life,  
Away from War, away from strife,  
This homely warmth, no hidden knife,  
Like in some birth, you were my wife.  
.  
[Verse 2]  
My hands, my blood, my mind, my heart,  
A Cupid's Spring on every part,  
To Fates I beg, “Give us a start,  
The stars do cry, seeing us apart.”  
.  
[Verse 3 and Crescendo]  
I'd die for you, but we would live.  
I'd take your thirst, might also give,  
A laugh to those kiss-able lips,  
Our love would grow, as dry pain dips.  
.  
[Chorus]  
You write like love, you breath like love,  
Like Aphrodite’s favourite dove,  
Like Venus-spawn, a red so bright,  
I don't know, ‘we’ just sounds so right??  
.  
[Verse 4]  
I'll feel your heart, along with blood,  
See your smile, but also the hurt,  
I'll see your eyes, I'll see your flood,  
Be there in your plenty…  
…but also dearth.  
.  
[Verse 5]  
Your lips like petals wreathed in dew,  
Of misty lilacs, ever new,  
Invite my own, their lush-red wine,  
A kiss to make sorrows divine.  
.  
[Refrain]  
To steal within your waiting arms,  
Is abode safe from life's alarms,  
Where fancies dwell like larks set free,  
And secret dreams take wing in me.  
.  
[Verse 6]  
These miles between us make me ache.  
How many more Autumns to rake?  
How much more hours before we make,  
A sweet dwelling, a moonlit lake?  
.  
[Chorus]  
You write like love, you breath like love,  
Like Aphrodite’s favourite dove,  
Like Venus-spawn, a red so bright,  
I don't know, ‘we’ just sounds so right??  
.  
[Outro]  
If loving you must end in woe,  
Come what may we'll together flow.  
These ecstasies though fleet in haste  
…  
Like summer nights, too dear to waste.
