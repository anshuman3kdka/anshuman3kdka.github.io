title: Dead Wolves Under The Tide

The yarn of Fate. The farm of hate,  
The harm would sate but not abate,  
The rising tide whose time has come,  
The fighting side to rest is laid.  
.  
Our Destiny's beautiful face,  
Unperturbed by our howling bays,  
The Pack would move, the pup is lost,  
They bother not with frenzied laze.  
.  
They're laced with reddish ivy leaves,  
The wolves are lambs, for she believes,  
That's not poison, our frets should cease,  
We'll sit in barns, we aim to please.  
.  
“These shackles are not your bracelets,  
They're not to love, nor to be set,  
Aside from every filthy norm,  
With which our love is now beset.”  
.  
The morrow wakes the Christmas crow,  
The murder rocks him to and fro,  
No gleaming eyes, no smirks to throw,  
They take the boat the dead now row.
