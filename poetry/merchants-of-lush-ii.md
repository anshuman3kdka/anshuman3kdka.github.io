We’ll wake on dewy grass,  
And forget how we fell,  
We’ll heat, rebuild the glass,  
From cores would fade our hell.  
.  
Through misted panes, we gaze,  
At phantoms in the air,  
They dance in shadowed haze,  
With whispers faint and rare.  
In corridors that twist and wind,  
We lose ourselves, we lose our mind,  
In labyrinths where shadows play,  
Our hearts, our souls, they slowly fray. 
.  
They have been untrue from start,  
To wood dwellers,  
While…  
We’ve been selling our hearts,  
To travelers.  
To travelers with tales to tell,  
To show us all from sails to shell,  
Three wishes in a magic lamp,  
To make our heart a tragic lamb.  
.  
In secret rooms with velvet walls,  
We bargain dreams as evening falls,  
The merchants smile with eyes so cold,  
They trade in souls, they trade in gold.  
This year the tides have risen high,  
Traders of love have smiled so wry.  
They’ve pulled the strings, the doves have sung,  
Fall in their quicksand, silver tongue.  
.  
Through endless nights, we wandered still,  
Beneath the moon, above the hill,  
Where every shadow hid a lie,  
And every truth was born to die.  
The roads we took, the paths we chose,  
Led us to doors that never close,  
A fleeting glimpse of what was real,  
Lost in the haze, the fading zeal.  
.  
Their words like smoke, they filled the air,  
With promises so thin, so fair,  
But as we reached, they slipped away,  
Like fleeting dreams at break of day.  
In hollow halls, their laughter rings,  
A melody of broken strings,  
And in the end, we stand alone,  
In fields of ash, where seeds were sown.  
.  
They told us tales of endless light,  
Of kingdoms vast and stars so bright,  
But in the dark, we found the truth,  
That all we had was stolen youth.  
The merchants’ eyes, so deep, so black,  
They lead us forth, but turn us back,  
To where we started, where we’ll end,  
In circles vast, with none to mend.  
.  
And as the dawn begins to break,  
We see the deals we chose to make,  
The glass we broke, the hearts we sold,  
In search of warmth, in search of gold.  
Yet in the dew, we find a trace,  
Of all we lost, of all we chase,  
And in the light of morning's glow,  
We see the path we did not know.  
.  
But still we rise, on dewy grass,  
Forget the fall, rebuild the glass,  
And though the core of hell remains,  
We forge anew, unbind our chains.
