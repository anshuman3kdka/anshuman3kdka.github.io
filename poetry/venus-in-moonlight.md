And sometimes when your cup goes cold,  
From frost of words that went untold,  
You stare down, a second too long,  
And in that hush, a tale unfolds.  
.  
Your filtered coffee, filtered heart,  
A silent call, an aimless dart,  
The way you weaved your lies so thin,  
As if you were a child of Sin.  
.  
A glance thrown here, a smile thrown there,  
And promises of love so rare,  
You spoke none of it, and yet see,  
How easily you did ensnare.  
.  
Angelic face, Devilish grace,  
Whose tired sighs caused hearts to race,  
Whose pretenses stole sleep for days,  
As if Venus in Moonlight lays.  
.  
Till now I wonder how you sound,  
Maybe because you never spoke,  
Maybe your sins wore down your tongue,  
Maybe you choked on hearts you broke.
