There's much to say when Earth is dead,  
When Sun next day sees one less head,  
‘The Star of Gold,’ the Elves have told,  
‘Will forget the look of his bed.’  
.  
They say he loved the Water’s Home,  
On green pastures his gaze did roam,  
The mountains high, where snow-pines lie,  
He craved all, down to Ocean’s foam.  
.  
The wondrous Earth had tales to sell,  
Of stairs to Heaven, Gates to Hell,  
The fish would play, the knights would sla  
And coins were tossed in magic well.  
.  
He now wanders the Milky Way,  
To other globes he cannot say,  
The Verse of hearts, a brand-new start,  
‘Nah, I'd rather just lose my way.’  
.  
But when at last he lays for dreams,  
His sleep drifts him to mossy streams,  
The Earth was one, and for one Sun,  
Now he won't wake, that's how it seems.
