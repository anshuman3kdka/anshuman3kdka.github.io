It’s right there, just within your reach,  
Care not about the trust you’ll breach,  
Pay no heed to my leather scales,  
Just pluck it out, you’ll leave no trails.  
.    
Ah! There you go, now take a bite,  
Nothing to do with wrong or right,  
The God won’t know despite his might,  
You’ll have all that, there shall be light.  
.   
He’ll never know what happens here,  
Nothing’s forbidden, have no fear,  
He lives too far, he loves you not,  
Come to me let him shed tears.  
.  
Don’t ask me why my tongue is green,  
Just do the deed you’ll not be seen,  
Our love he doesnt have to know,  
Just eat the fruit, and stoop so low.
