Your filter coffee, filtered heart,  
A fruitless quest, an aimless dart.  
Like Cupid's sting has but just pain,  
A web of souls, no love to gain.  
.  
Your web of souls once captured me,  
With men like me hoping to be,  
The one who wins the Spider's trust,  
As if the Spider needed dust.  
.  
As if she saw your flesh and skin,  
As if you weren't just a fly.  
Ha! She the closest kin of sin,  
For such venom why would one try?  
.  
Oh, but they tried and yes I tried,  
To sail ahead against the tide,  
The web of souls like Siren's tune,  
The Spider's gaze caused men to swoon.  
.  
The delights of our enchantress,  
Lie under Saturn's chill caress.
