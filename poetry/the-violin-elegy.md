The violins struck a higher note,  
My corpse flows down in wooden boat.  
The dead man’s curse will always float,  
And seep inside his lover’s throat.  
.  
His lover’s throat has faded white,  
She’ll ensnare you and take your sight.  
You’ll long the touch of fresh sunlight,  
She’ll buy your soul but you won’t fight.  
.  
She’ll whisper soft, alter your hue,  
Will make you limitlessly blue.  
Endless skies, no sunset to gaze,  
Another dead man’s grave she’ll raze.  
.  
She’ll raze the romance of the words,  
Slaughter the letter-carrying birds,  
And lust after the sinful breed,  
Of murderers and players of Greed.  
.  
The violins end a love story,  
Which was no love only gory,  
But tell that to Poetry’s heart,  
Who ends the tales that never start.
