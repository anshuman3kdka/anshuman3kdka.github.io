The hallway light still flickers;  
I’ve decided not to fix it.  
Small hesitations suit the house now.  
They go unnoticed, like she did.  

The dust returns in polite waves.  
She hated clutter, but now  
even the ashtray feels arranged  
an accidental shrine to argument.  

I hear she’s in a town  
where midnight comes without sound,  
where windows don’t creak  
and the clocks have softer hands.  

She always wanted the kind of silence  
that doesn’t require approval.  
We kept the other kind  
the silence of shared rooms,  
the hush before someone apologizes.  

The curtains still hold  
a faint suggestion of her perfume  
something like rain  
trying not to be noticed.  

She took her coat, but not the scarf  
that held too many goodbyes.  
I left it by the window  
where she once watched the midnight trains  
and said nothing.  

The calendar remains open to June.  
She left in June.  
I do not correct it.  
Some months earn their permanence.  

If she returns  
and I still expect  
there’s tea in the drawer,  
and the chair still knows her shape.  

I sleep late now.  
But sometimes I wake  
when the clock leans toward midnight  
just long enough  
to listen for footsteps  
that do not arrive.  
.  
.
