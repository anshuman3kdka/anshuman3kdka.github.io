That drunken gaze from miles afar,  
Those drooping lids like falling star,  
Tell, what Satan could seduce her?  
Which incantation? What wizard?  
.  
Those red guards to heaven's abyss,  
Their touch on flesh you'll always miss,  
Pray tell, for whom will they part now?  
What Godsend will relish her kiss?  
.  
Hours would pass and so would decades,  
Your voice you would hear as tirades,  
Your wish for Venus unfulfilled,  
Then wage crusades after crusades.  
.  
She'll want from you the starry skies,  
Gift her a looking glass instead,  
Shut your gaze and drown in brown eyes,  
Or you'll be dead before you're dead.
