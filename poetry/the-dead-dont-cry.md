Used to say an eye for an eye,  
There’s sin in them her eyes so wry,  
You can give all, give your best try.  
.  
But the dead don’t come,  
And the dead don’t cry.  
.  
There’s venom in that sparkling gaze,  
A beauty in the moonlight lays,  
Hear her! How your heart she will pry.  
.  
For the dead don’t feel,  
And the dead don’t cry.  
.  
Your red roses, she’ll paint them black,  
Till all that’s yours you will then lack,  
You’ll fall for each lie after lie,  
.  
For the dead are false,  
And the dead don’t cry.  
.  
She knows no guilt, carries no fear,  
Of wrath of God for sins she bears,  
You’ll let out a self-pitying sigh,  
.  
But the dead don’t care,  
And the dead don’t cry.  
.  
What do you have, save a photoframe?  
Of who won’t again be the same,  
Wish she’d stayed for a last good-bye.  
.  
But the dead aren’t here,  
Listening to you cry.  
.
