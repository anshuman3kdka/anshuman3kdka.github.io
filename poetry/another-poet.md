The morrow’s lark, the midnight dark,  
The hue of noon, the evening’s moon,  
Such evening’s moon, with Sun pairs,  
And to such Sun, your warmth compares.  
.  
The hue of noon, your gentle croon,  
Both cause the men to sway and swoon,  
Both cause the men death and decay,  
Your touch like heatstrokes in mid-june.  
.  
The midnight dark is heaven's light,  
When held against your heart, a blight,  
A pitch black heart with empty veins,  
No morals known, no binds nor reins.  
  
.  
  
The morrow's lark will sing for me,  
My elegy, your eulogy,  
Another Poet falls for thee,  
One more life, no apologies.
