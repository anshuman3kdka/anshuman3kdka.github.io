**Learning:** Using chained `.map().filter()` operations on large datasets (like the client-side search index) creates significant performance bottlenecks due to creating garbage collection (GC) overhead by allocating intermediate objects that immediately get filtered out. Using `forEach` inside large loops also adds overhead through closure allocations.
**Action:** When filtering and transforming large arrays in performance-sensitive frontend paths, use a single standard `for` loop to conditionally apply transformations and `push()` into a new array.
