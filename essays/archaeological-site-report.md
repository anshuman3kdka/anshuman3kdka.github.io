## I. SITE OVERVIEW

Fellow excavators, let us dispense with the pleasantries. We have uncovered a mass grave. Not of bodies, but of creativity.

We have unearthed millions of identical rectangular artifacts, composed of decomposing wood pulp and bound in covers featuring silhouetted couples standing under umbrellas. Carbon dating suggests these texts were mass-produced during a dark age called the "Engineering College Boom," a period where ancient Indian civilization decided that the only way to process the trauma of calculus was to write bad fiction about it.

For decades, scholars assumed these were distinct stories. They were not. We are looking at a single, repetitive chant. A structural glitch in the human imagination.

## II. ARTIFACT ANALYSIS: THE TRINITY OF DOOM

Upon closer inspection of the texts (titled things like *Half-Girlfriend*, *Quarter-Boyfriend*, or *Three Mistakes of My Life Which Were Buying This Book*), we find a rigid, almost religious adherence to three specific structural pillars. These pillars are load-bearing; remove one, and the entire narrative collapses into a pile of unread blog posts.

### A. The "Potato" Variant (The Protagonist)

In every single text, the central figure is a male specimen of aggressive averageness. Let us call him "The Madhav."

- **Physical Description:** He is consistently described as having the aesthetic appeal of a damp biscuit. He has no hobbies, no discernible personality, and his English vocabulary is limited to "Hi," "Bye," and "I love you."

- **The Anomaly:** Despite possessing the charisma of a traffic cone, this specimen inexplicably attracts the "Goddess" (see below). Ancient historians are baffled. Was this a fertility idol? A representation of the Everyman's delusion?

- **Function:** His primary function is to whine. He whines about his grades. He whines about his English. He whines that the Goddess is talking to other males. He is the gravitational center of a black hole of insecurity.

### B. The "Adonis" Construct (The Threat)

Orbiting the Goddess is a secondary male figure. Let us call him "The Kabir."

- **Characteristics:** The Kabir is physically perfect. He plays the guitar. He is captain of the sports team. He speaks the ancient elite dialect known as "South Delhi Accent." He is kind, supportive, and objectively the better choice in every conceivable metric.

- **The Ritualistic Hatred:** The narrative demands that The Madhav hates The Kabir with the fire of a thousand suns. The Madhav convinces the reader that The Kabir is "arrogant" simply because he showers regularly and knows how to talk to women without weeping.

- **Fate:** The Kabir must lose. In a defiance of natural selection, the narrative forces the Goddess to reject this genetic lottery winner in favor of the Potato. This suggests the ancients practiced a form of masochism we cannot fully comprehend.

### C. The "Goddess" (The Prize)

The female lead. She is beautiful. She is intelligent. She is "The Most Popular Girl in College."

- **Agency:** None. She exists solely to be a trophy for the Potato to unlock after he completes enough levels of self-pity.

- **The Logic Failure:** Her decision-making centers appear damaged. She spends 300 pages treating The Potato like a friend, only to suddenly realize in the Epilogue—usually at an airport or a train station—that his persistent stalking was actually "true love."

## III. THE RITUAL OF THE PLOT (The Cycle of Trauma)

The structural integrity of these novels relies on a sequence of events so predictable it must have been mandated by law.

1. The Ragging/orientation: The Potato meets the Goddess. He stares at her. It is creepy. She smiles. He assumes marriage is imminent.

2. The "Friendship" Purgatory: They become friends. The Potato hates this. He wants to own her. He calls this "love." The Goddess treats him like a human being; he resents her for not treating him like a husband.

3. The Great Misunderstanding: The Potato sees the Goddess laughing with The Kabir. The Potato suffers a mental breakdown. He gets drunk. He says something unforgivable. He fails an exam.

4. The Redemption (That Isn't Redemption): The Potato does not improve himself. He does not learn a skill. He simply waits. Eventually, the Goddess’s life falls apart (usually due to parental pressure to marry an NRI), and she settles for the Potato because he is... there. He is persistent. He is the mold that refuses to be scrubbed away.

## IV. SOCIOLOGICAL CONCLUSION

Why did the ancients worship this structure?

We hypothesize that these texts served as a mass sedative for a generation of sexually frustrated engineering students. The "Average Guy Gets The Girl" narrative was not a story; it was a government-issued hallucination. It told millions of young men that they didn't need to develop personalities, hygiene, or social skills—they just needed to wait, whine, and eventually, the universe would hand them a supermodel.

**Final Verdict:** The civilization did not die of war or famine. It died of exhaustion. It read the same plot about a boy named Rahul/Madhav/Krish chasing a girl named Ananya/Riya/Simran for forty years until their brains simply liquefied out of their ears.

**Recommendation:** Rebury the site. Pour concrete over the entrance. Do not let the virus escape.
