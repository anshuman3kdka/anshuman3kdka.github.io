    "content": "In the dream, we were in a school. It was ours, but it wasn't. The CMS building is linear, but this one grew in every direction at once. It had the look of an international hospital—vast, white, with flickering lights sunken into the ceiling. Like the lights in the exam hall. Exactly like those. It was night, though there were no windows. We passed classrooms that were modern and new, unlike the worn rooms where we spend our days. The corridors narrowed as we walked. They narrowed until our arms grazed the cold walls on both sides. We were the only ones in the halls. The silence was a physical weight. Sometimes a few students would pass us, laughing as if it were a regular Tuesday. We reached the center of the building where the hallways met. They stretched out from the middle in every direction, long and thin like the legs of a spider. The lobby was huge. It had the same grey floor as the ICSE hall. In the middle of the floor, a hospital stretcher stood alone. A regular hockey stick lay on the bedsheet. A metal blade had been fixed into the wood, the sharp edge curving out. The blade was wet with blood. We moved past it and kept walking. We went down another corridor and into a classroom. The lights here were low, humming with a failing voltage. We stood in the dimness and watched the shadows. We didn't look away. Then the voltage surged. The lights turned a blinding, surgical",

Which clings on to them, like sorrow's cousin, Which we call hope, And it promises 'The city is great!' Which we call hope. Nearly noon, he has unpacked, His heart's luggage, his aching rack, He takes a whiff of city's scent, And wonders what the dust had meant. 'The city is great!' and so, he must walk, Down the new lanes. He must trust the dust, and its purple soot, And meet new names. But the city's quick, he sees not people He's seen, again. Here people walk with many stains of touch And remain sane. Twilight, and strange weariness hits, These people talk, these people kiss, And yet their love never quite fits, These people part, but never miss? These people, they're traders, they deal in hearts, And smile so dull, Not cruel, not without a soul. They are just, Transactional. Rotates endlessly, this organised Mob, No one complains. He guesses it's simpler, than finding love, And going through pains. They'll pick their pens and write of love, And in the same breath, elegies. Their tongues of crow, and words of dove, And each word is affection's fees. At midnight, he gives in to this, And buys a cold and painted kiss. He drinks the city, dark and deep, And sells the soul he meant to keep. New morning breaks on graying skies, With city dust within his eyes. He joins t",

Wheeler Railway Bookstore.\" Lead Archeologist: Dr. Xylos, Curator of Pre Apocalyptic Cringe Date: Year 4025 (Post Logic Era) I. SITE OVERVIEW Fellow excavators, let us dispense with the pleasantries. We have uncovered a mass grave. Not of bodies, but of creativity. We have unearthed millions of identical rectangular artifacts, composed of decomposing wood pulp and bound in covers featuring silhouetted couples standing under umbrellas. Carbon dating suggests these texts were mass produced during a dark age called the \"Engineering College Boom,\" a period where ancient Indian civilization decided that the only way to process the trauma of calculus was to write bad fiction about it. For decades, scholars assumed these were distinct stories. They were not. We are looking at a single, repetitive chant. A structural glitch in the human imagination. II. ARTIFACT ANALYSIS: THE TRINITY OF DOOM Upon closer inspection of the texts (titled things like Half Girlfriend , Quarter Boyfriend , or Three Mistakes of My Life Which Were Buying This Book ), we find a rigid, almost religious adherence to three specific structural pillars. These pillars are load bearing; remove one, and the entire narrative collapses into a pile of unread blog pos",

To travelers with tales to tell, To show us all from sails to shell, Three wishes in a magic lamp, To make our heart a tragic lamb. . In secret rooms with velvet walls, We bargain dreams as evening falls, The merchants smile with eyes so cold, They trade in souls, they trade in gold. This year the tides have risen high, Traders of love have smiled so wry. They’ve pulled the strings, the doves have sung, Fall in their quicksand, silver tongue. . Through endless nights, we wandered still, Beneath the moon, above the hill, Where every shadow hid a lie, And every truth was born to die. The roads we took, the paths we chose, Led us to doors that never close, A fleeting glimpse of what was real, Lost in the haze, the fading zeal. .

I hear she’s in a town where midnight comes without sound, where windows don’t creak and the clocks have softer hands. She always wanted the kind of silence that doesn’t require approval. We kept the other kind the silence of shared rooms, the hush before someone apologizes. The curtains still hold a faint suggestion of her perfume something like rain trying not to be noticed. She took her coat, but not the scarf that held too many goodbyes. I left it by the window where she once watched the midnight trains and said nothing. The calendar remains open to June. She left in June. I do not correct it. Some months earn their permanence. If she returns and I still expect there’s tea in the drawer, and the chair still knows her shape. I sleep late now. But sometimes I wake when the clock leans toward midnight just long enough to listen for footsteps that do not arrive. . .",

The pirates are singing sea shanties that smell of salt and rum, and one of them is sharpening a blade meant for the captain's back, humming as he works. The elves are moving through the silver birch trees, and one of them carries a secret so ancient and precious that even speaking its name would shatter the stars. And sometimes, when a single blade of grass trembles in the windless dark, you'll know there's a hobbit trying to slip away on a journey that's been calling to him in dreams. But when he finally reaches that far green country he's imagined, the very same blades of grass will bend beneath his feet, and the same trampled field of corn will stretch golden and endless under the same indifferent moon. A wolf howls at the ragged edge of the forest where the wild things keep their vigil, but the sheep in their pen don't even lift their heads, lost in whatever innocent dreams sheep are granted. And high in the crumbling tower window, a candle flickers once as though some ghost has passed too close, then holds steady and bright while far below, someone counts the cobblestones in the courtyard over and over, having long ago forgotten what number they started with or why it ever mattered. I love nighttimes, when the world becomes exactly what it alwa",

A border drawn by the hands he never shook, claims him without warning. Across the jagged wire, a boy same tired eyes, same empty gut coughs up his final breath.

The Thames runs red with setting sun, The Ganges' holy waters run With echoes of what we've begun— A revolution's thread unspun. . Our songs grow faint, our voices thin, As moonlight paints our pallid skin. The natural order wears so thin: Cats growl, dogs coo—the world's chagrin. And that lark who once sang at dawn, Now heralds twilight's creeping spawn. The eclipse approaches, light withdrawn— What rises once the dark has gone?",

    "content": "The violins struck a higher note, My corpse flows down in wooden boat. The dead man’s curse will always float, And seep inside his lover’s throat. . His lover’s throat has faded white, She’ll ensnare you and take your sight. You’ll long the touch of fresh sunlight, She’ll buy your soul but you won’t fight. . She’ll whisper soft, alter your hue, Will make you limitlessly blue. Endless skies, no sunset to gaze, Another dead man’s grave she’ll raze. . She’ll raze the romance of the words, Slaughter the letter carrying birds, And lust after the sinful breed, Of murderers and players of Greed. . The violins end a love story, Which was no love only gory, But tell that to Poetry’s heart, Who ends the tales that never start.",

    "content": "That drunken gaze from miles afar, Those drooping lids like falling star, Tell, what Satan could seduce her? Which incantation? What wizard? . Those red guards to heaven's abyss, Their touch on flesh you'll always miss, Pray tell, for whom will they part now? What Godsend will relish her kiss? . Hours would pass and so would decades, Your voice you would hear as tirades, Your wish for Venus unfulfilled, Then wage crusades after crusades. . She'll want from you the starry skies, Gift her a looking glass instead, Shut your gaze and drown in brown eyes, Or you'll be dead before you're dead.",

    "content": "And sometimes when your cup goes cold, From frost of words that went untold, You stare down, a second too long, And in that hush, a tale unfolds. . Your filtered coffee, filtered heart, A silent call, an aimless dart, The way you weaved your lies so thin, As if you were a child of Sin. . A glance thrown here, a smile thrown there, And promises of love so rare, You spoke none of it, and yet see, How easily you did ensnare. . Angelic face, Devilish grace, Whose tired sighs caused hearts to race, Whose pretenses stole sleep for days, As if Venus in Moonlight lays. . Till now I wonder how you sound, Maybe because you never spoke, Maybe your sins wore down your tongue, Maybe you choked on hearts you broke.",
