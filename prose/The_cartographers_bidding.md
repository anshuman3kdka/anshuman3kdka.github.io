Long after the ink hardened, the first lung gave way. Inside a quiet space where old paper and cold tea lingered in the air, metal scraped slowly over wood. Was that hesitation in the fingers? Or just pride leaving a mark? Hard to say. With a slow blink from the God-Cartographer, the boundary jolted sideways, cutting through purple flowers swaying in a field.

Midnight settles where Sergeant Elias fights dust down his throat. One fist full of dirt, no different than what lies just beside it, somehow marks the splintered line between ‘martyr’ and ‘enemy’. A border drawn by the hands he never shook, claims him without warning. Across the jagged wire, a boy - same tired eyes, same empty gut - coughs up his final breath. Their blood paints matching crimson stains on an earth that does not blink. Ghost shapes form here. Not stone, but time - ten centuries of skeletons piled up, guarding some line a god drew once, yawned, and called eternal.
