# The Cartographer’s Bidding

The ink dried long before the first lung collapsed. In a silent room smelling of vellum and stale tea, a nib had scratched across a table. A tremor in the hand? A smudge of vanity? It didn’t matter. The God-Cartographer blinked, and the border zig-zagged through a meadow of lavender.

Now, Sergeant Elias chokes on iron and grit. He clutches a handful of soil that looks identical to the soil three inches to his left, yet that microscopic gap is the jagged difference between “Martyr” and “Invader.” He dies defending a stroke of a pen he has never seen. Across the invisible wire, a boy with the same blue eyes and the same hollow stomach gurgles his final breath. They bleed the same shade of crimson into the same indifferent earth. It is a geometry of ghosts. A thousand years of bone, stacked high to protect a line drawn by a god whose afternoon needed filling.
