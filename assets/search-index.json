There you go, now take a bite, Nothing to do with wrong or right, The God won’t know despite his might, You’ll have all that, there shall be light. . He’ll never know what happens here, Nothing’s forbidden, have no fear, He lives too far, he loves you not, Come to me let him shed tears. .

When Man perishes then God too dies, He's in our heads, but He's not lies. We thought Him up, yet still He's there, He thinks like Man, like Man He sighs. . When the men worship Him they praise Him not. They worship the richness of their own thought. The greatest invention of Man ain't wheel. Adam's the Creator, Creation is God.",

    "content": "We’ll wake on dewy grass, And forget how we fell, We’ll heat, rebuild the glass, From cores would fade our hell. . Through misted panes, we gaze, At phantoms in the air, They dance in shadowed haze, With whispers faint and rare. In corridors that twist and wind, We lose ourselves, we lose our mind, In labyrinths where shadows play, Our hearts, our souls, they slowly fray. . They have been untrue from start, To wood dwellers, While… We’ve been selling our hearts, To travelers. To travelers with tales to tell, To show us all from sails to shell, Three wishes in a magic lamp, To make our heart a tragic lamb. . In secret rooms with velvet walls, We bargain dreams as evening falls, The merchants smile with eyes so cold, They trade in souls, they trade in gold. This year the tides have risen high, Traders of love have smiled so wry. They’ve pulled the strings, the doves have sung, Fall in their quicksand, silver tongue. . Through endless nights, we wandered still, Beneath the moon, above the hill, Where every shadow hid a lie, And every truth was born to die. The roads we took, the paths we chose, Led us to doors that never close, A fleeting glimpse of what was real, Lost in the haze, the fading zeal. . Their words like smoke, they filled the air, With promises so thin, so fair, But as we reached, they slipped away, Like fleeting dreams at break of day. In hollow halls, their laughter rings, A melody of broken strings, And in the end, we stand alone, In fields of ash, where seeds were sown. . They told us tales of endless light, Of kingdoms vast and stars so bright, But in the dark, we found the truth, That all we had was stolen youth. The merchants’ eyes, so deep, so black, They lead us forth, but turn us back, To where we started, where we’ll end, In circles vast, with none to mend. . And as the dawn begins to break, We see the deals we chose to make, The glass we broke, the hearts we sold, In search of warmth, in search of gold. Yet in the dew, we find a trace, Of all we lost, of all we chase, And in the light of morning's glow, We see the path we did not know. . But still we rise, on dewy grass, Forget the fall, rebuild the glass, And though the core of hell remains, We forge anew, unbind our chains.",

You see, a heart that's always true, Not affected by evil’s flu, Not saddened in the days of blue, Nor gladdened by a murder's view, Is what we need for this concoction, We'll sell it at Friday's auction, To orphans who seek adoption, Safe life was never an option. . Fear not! It's not a mutant drink, Nor for it do the werewolves sing, It does its job before you blink, Now ships will sail in seas of ink. . So please sir before you supper, Take a small minute to suffer, You'd give your heart, were you tougher, For Hecate’s sake sir! Don't stutter! . My cause is just and so are you, Come ruin this globe, build it anew.",

Through crowded streets we weave and wind, Our former selves left far behind. For some grand cause, we've been conscribed, Though doubts still linger in our mind. . In parks once green, now ashen gray, We rest our bones at close of day. The world's turned inside out, they say, Yet here, like statues, we must stay. . The Thames runs red with setting sun, The Ganges' holy waters run With echoes of what we've begun— A revolution's thread unspun. . Our songs grow faint, our voices thin, As moonlight paints our pallid skin. The natural order wears so thin: Cats growl, dogs coo—the world's chagrin. . And that lark who once sang at dawn, Now heralds twilight's creeping spawn. The eclipse approaches, light withdrawn— What rises once the dark has gone?",

A glance thrown here, a smile thrown there, And promises of love so rare, You spoke none of it, and yet see, How easily you did ensnare. . Angelic face, Devilish grace, Whose tired sighs caused hearts to race, Whose pretenses stole sleep for days, As if Venus in Moonlight lays. . Till now I wonder how you sound, Maybe because you never spoke, Maybe your sins wore down your tongue, Maybe you choked on hearts you broke.",

He searches all the day for shore, But six till night, his land is you. . Journeys the Wild West, Eastern skies, He needs and heals the Orcish cries.
